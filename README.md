# Web-Scraper-using-BeautifulSoup
Web Scraping done using python and beautifulsoup4 - Beginner level

Just for the basic understanding of how the scraper works.

This is a fork of [mfakharealam's](https://github.com/mfakharealam/Web-Scraper-using-BeautifulSoup) project.  I'm working to remove the reliance on H2 headers or other CSS attributes as these methods of SEO are being used less on webpages.  This pulls heaadlines and URLs from theverge.com only.
